Aim: Creating a service that accepts the necessary information and sends emails

Solution: 
	Using open source email provider's api's.
	Better to have more than one email service providers such that if one of the service gets failed we can quickly use another one's.
	
Solution mainly focuses on back-end work.

Used Node.js for building it.
Using Node.js for backend, you automatically get all the pros of full stack JavaScript development, such as:

-->better efficiency and overall developer productivity
-->code sharing and reuse
-->speed and performance
-->easy knowledge sharing within a team
-->a huge number of free tools
